Design patterns are solutions for commonly recurring problems in object oriented design.

Why study design patterns?
--------------------------
Avoid reinventing the solution.

We can benefit from the experience of other designers who have successfully applied these patterns in their designs. We get ready-made high quality solutions to commonly recurring problems in design.

Applying design patterns in your project will make it reusable, flexible and easily maintainable. There is no need of redesigning every time, the design has to be reused.
